Never lose track of an important meeting again! With Task Calendar, users can keep track of important events and better manage their time.

## Usage

Usage is simple. The current day is displayed in real-time at the top of the page, as shown in below.

Directly below, the user will find timeblocks within which he or she can enter tasks. Each box is color-coded based on its position relative to the current time, i.e. past times are red, the current time is green, and future times are blue. Hitting enter will save the textbox content in the browser's local storage.

Hitting the adjacent blue button seen in the screenshot above will display a prompt containing all previously inputted tasks. Clicking anywhere on the page closes the prompt.
